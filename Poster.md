# Project Description
A poster with three interactive user points using JS and basic HTML/CSS

#### Design Ideas and Inspirations

Disney's advertisement promoting their adventure parks featured a variety of characters, including the fairy godmother wielding magic and the bibidi boo boutique. This served as my inspiration for this project. I came up with the idea for an album featuring some of my favourite Disney images, which requires a password to access. Once inside, users can modify the image and reset it using a button to display fireworks that are randomly generated and come in a variety of colours. An idea to customise this interaction was to create an input box with any text—from your name to a random string—and observe how that text changes colour in response to the input The inspiration for this came from the 70s movies, where as the final scenes approached, the text would display and change in size from big to small or small to big, finishing in a grand gesture. In the same way, I have thought to incorporate this into the project. Vary in size using an interactive slider where you can make the text size big to small.
